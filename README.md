![RedGreenâ€”A new way to view unit test output in Xcode](assets/rdgn_logo.png)

__<span style="color: rgb(225,0,0);">Red</span><span style="color: rgb(0,160,0);">Green</span>__ is an extension library for __SenTestingKit__ that makes the test output easier to parse by humans. 

## Usage 

### CocoaPods

Add the following to your Podfile:

    pod 'RedGreen", :git => 'https://github.com/neilco/RedGreen.git'

And then, from Terminal, run this:

    pod install

Open the workspace. Build. Test. Bacon. 'Cos you're sizzlin'.

### Standalone

Add __SenTestLog+RedGreen.{h,m}__ to your project's test target. Build. Test. Rejoice. 

## Examples

### Life before <span style="color: rgb(225,0,0);">Red</span><span style="color: rgb(0,160,0);">Green</span>

Seriously. As quickly as you can, find the tests that __<span style="color: rgb(0,160,0);">passed</span>__. Quite difficult, huh?

### Same output with <span style="color: rgb(225,0,0);">Red</span><span style="color: rgb(0,160,0);">Green</span>

__<span style="color: rgb(225,0,0);">Red</span><span style="color: rgb(0,160,0);">Green</span>__ makes that same information much more readable. Again, find the tests that __<span style="color: rgb(0,160,0);">passed</span>__. Much easier, right?

### One more thing...

We can do better and if we can, we should. __<span style="color: rgb(225,0,0);">Red</span><span style="color: rgb(0,160,0);">Green</span>__ has support for the excellent [XcodeColors](https://github.com/robbiehanson/XcodeColors) plugin, which makes visually parsing the test output a doddle. Now you can find the tests that __<span style="color: rgb(0,160,0);">passed</span>__ __without having to actually read anything__. A quick glance is all that is needed.
